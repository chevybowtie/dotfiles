# `.bashrc` is the place to put stuff that applies only to bash
# itself, such as alias and function definitions, shell options,
# and prompt settings. (You could also put key bindings there, but
# for bash they normally go into `~/.inputrc`.)

# `.bash_aliases` is my extraction of all aliases (sourced in .bashrc)

# `.bash_exports` is my extraction of all exports (sourced in this file)

# `.profile` is the place to put stuff that applies to your whole
# session, such as programs that you want to start when you log in
# (but not graphical programs, they go into a different file), and
# environment variable definitions. This was the UNIX Bourne shell
# default start-up.

# `.bash_profile` can be used instead of `~/.profile`, but it is read
# by bash only, not by any other shell. (This is mostly a concern
# if you want your initialization files to work on multiple machines
# and your login shell isn't bash on all of them.) This is a logical
# place to include ~/.bashrc. If `.bash_profile` doesn't exist,
# bash also tries `.bash_login` before falling back to `.profile`

# According to the bash man page, `.bash_profile` is executed for login
# shells, while `.bashrc` is executed for interactive non-login shells.
# When you login (eg: type username and password) via console, either
# physically sitting at the machine when booting, or remotely via ssh:
# `.bash_profile` is executed to configure things before the initial
# command prompt. If you've already logged into your machine and open
# a new terminal window (xterm) inside Gnome or KDE, then .bashrc is
# executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when
# you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.

# https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/zshbash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc/
# For Bash, read down the appropriate column. Executes A, then B, then
# C, etc. The B1, B2, B3 means it executes only the first of those files
# found.
